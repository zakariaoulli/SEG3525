**Product type** : app / website



**Product concept** : An application that uses google cloud software (or others, TBD) to map out your route and wake you up on arrival to your destination. It also includes other functionalities such as a general GPS or a speedometer.

  - As mentioned, would use google cloud API for maps and app development tools
    - Browser version would use other methods to create the app

  - Multi purpose locational service app with built in alarm functionality
    - Gives you the ability to set your route on the app and will notify you on approach.
    - Can be used as a general GPS to give you the recommended routes that will take you to your destination in the fastest and easiest way possible.
    - Can wake you up if you dozed off and you're nearing your stop;
        - Smart watch compatibility needed
        - Would send a small electrical current to wake you up. (Alternative ways TBD)

   - If allowed by the user, enables data collection as to run a profit off the app
        - Selling this data would provide us a way to sustainably update the app without extorting to ads
        - Alternative : Ads 
           - May include in-app purchase to remove ads or to acquire other perks (TBD)

   - Can be used as a speedometer 
        - i.e. walking, running, biking, etc.
            - Lake data and support is unclear
