Overall Look and Feel of Nudge
====
Nudge has a minimalist, modern, techy feel to it. 
Our innovative design should make the user feel energized, invigorated, and excited to explore.

Color theme
====
We chose to use bright colours and contrasting shades to give our website an industrial, modern look. 
The bright colours will capture the user’s attention and the use of dark colours will balance out the bright colours so the user does not feel overwhelmed.
We chose to use colours associated with traffic lights because we want them to associate being on the road with Nudge.

These are our main colours:
yellow - #F1F119
cyan - #44D6C4
dark grey - #2D2D39
off-white - #F4F8FD
off-black - #171717

Other color shades:
====
- yellow: #F2F21F 
- red: #E60E0E 
- green: #20E634 ;  #22F237
- sky/diamond blue: #32D4E6 ; #39EAFF

Iconographie
====
We will use icons with a flat design to match the theme and look that we’re aiming for with the website. 
The icons we will use will match our colour theme (they will be the same colour as the colours outlined above).

Typographie
====
We decided to use different fonts for different elements of the website. The fonts we used are from Google fonts.

The fonts we will use include: 
Montserrat: navigation bar, headings
Raleway: paragraphs

Links
====
Links will not be underlined and should change colour when the user hovers over them. 
Colors for links may vary depending on the section.

Buttons
====
Buttons will be flat, to avoid the outdated 3D, metallic look. 
We will use the variations of the colours outlined above.
